# celoce_epr

This repository contains the scripts used for the analysis of EPR spectrum of CelOCE.

### epr_initial_guess 

This jupyter notebook was used to get reasonable initial values for EPR spin-Hamiltonian parameters prior to EasySpin simulations.   
Code tested with python 3.9 

### epr_fit 

This matlab code was used to get final values for EPR spin-Hamiltonian parameters using EasySpin.   
Code tested with matlab R2022b and EasySpin 6.0.0
